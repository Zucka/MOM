\chapter{MOM Implementation}

In the previous chapters we looked at the design and implementation of the different system part there are in the Media-Online Management (MOM).
In this chapter we are going to show how it all of the parts are working together.

In figure \ref{fig:deployment} is a deployment and component diagram of the Media-Online Management system. 
The components Website, API and Daemon on the server have been implemented independently of each other such that if a component was to be replaced the other components will not be affected.
