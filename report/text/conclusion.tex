\chapter{Conclusion}


First we need to take a look at the problem statement again.
\begin{verse}
\textit{Parents are not able to help their children administer their IT/TV consumption.\\
This results in their children getting a lessened learning ability, a bad sleeping pattern and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.\\
How can hardware identification and webservices give parents the tools to help their children manage their media consumption?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How do we identify unique users in a subtle and child friendly way.
		\item How do we enforce restrictions on media devices.
		\item How do we facilitate concepts as rules, permissions and chores without parents interaction.
	\end{itemize}
\end{verse}
