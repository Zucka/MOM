\section{Prototype Implemtation}
The prototype is designed to prove the concept of the requirements to direct the power to and away from the media, control a tag reader, communicate with the server and it need to be a Embedded system. \newline
To prove the requerments the system the to be able to: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read and accept/decline tags in communication with a server though a online connection.
	\item Have a good system structur moniter the server connection.
	\item Regulate the power to a device recording to senario.
	\item Manage the time usaged and user restigtions. 
	\item Communicat system status to user though LED light indication. 
\end{itemize}

The Arduino hardware platform is made a base for the prototype as analysed in
