\section{Prototype Implemtation}
The prototype is designed to prove the concept of the requirements to direct the power to and away from the media, control a tag reader, communicate with the server and it need to be a Embedded system. \newline
To prove the requerments the system the to be able to: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read and accept/decline tags in communication with a server though a online connection.
	\item Have a good system structur moniter the server connection.
	\item Regulate the power recording to the senario.
	\item Manage the time usaged and user restigtions. 
	\item Communicat system status to user though LED light indication. 
\end{itemize}

The Arduino hardware platform is made the base for the prototype as analysed in section \ref{HardwarePlatform}.
To make a functional prototype was a Arduino Uno equiped ethernet port chosen. To the Arduino Uno is a RFID shield and breadboard connected.        
Before looking deeper in system structur of the controller is the code used to communicat with the RFID shield and ethernet port dokumented to give better knowlagde how they work.
