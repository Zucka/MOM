\section{Prototype Implemtation}
The prototype is designed to prove the concept of the requirements to direct the power to and away from the media, control a tag reader, communicate with the server and it need to be a Embedded system. \newline
To prove the requirements the system the to be able to: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read and accept/decline tags in communication with a server though a online connection.
	\item Have a good system structure monitor the server connection.
	\item Regulate the power recording to the scenario.
	\item Manage the time usage and user restrictions. 
	\item Communicate system status to user though LED light indication. 
\end{itemize}

The Arduino hardware platform is made the base on the prototype as analyzed in section \ref{HardwarePlatform}.
To make a functional prototype the Arduino Uno became equipped with a Ethernet port. To the Arduino Uno is a RFID shield and breadboard connected.        
First a deeper look into the structure of the controller is shown. Then some code to shown the communication with the RFID shield and Ethernet port is documented to give better knowledge how they work.
